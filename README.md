# FIFA-PLAYER-ANALYSIS
**Proposal for Analyzing the FIFA 2022 CSV Dataset**

### **Introduction**
The FIFA 2022 CSV dataset provides comprehensive data on players featured in the Career Mode from FIFA 15 to FIFA 22. This dataset allows for multiple comparative analyses of players over time, including trends in player attributes, budget constraints for competitive team building, and the evolution of key skills in top-tier players. The dataset includes over 100 attributes per player, covering aspects such as attacking, skills, defense, mentality, goalkeeping skills, and personal data.

### **Objectives**
This project aims to explore the FIFA 2022 dataset through various analytical approaches to gain insights into player evolution, budget efficiency in team building, and key attribute trends. The specific objectives include:

1. **Historical Comparison of Players**
   - Analyze the progression of key attributes of iconic players such as Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.
   - Compare in-game statistics to real-life performance data.
   - Identify which attributes changed the most over time.

2. **Budget Optimization for a Competitive Team**
   - Determine the ideal budget required to assemble a competitive squad at the level of the top European teams.
   - Identify the threshold at which increased spending yields diminishing returns in terms of team performance.
   - Compare team formation strategies based on overall ratings versus potential ratings.

3. **Trends in Key Attributes Among Top Players**
   - Analyze trends in attributes like Agility, Ball Control, and Strength among the top 5% of players across FIFA versions.
   - Identify whether FIFA has progressively emphasized technical skills or physical attributes over different versions.
   - Determine how these trends influence gameplay and competitive strategies.

### **Methodology**
1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
   - Load and explore the dataset to understand the structure and missing values.
   - Standardize attribute names and handle changes in field definitions (e.g., "defending marking awareness").
   - Remove duplicate attributes to ensure consistency across FIFA versions.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualize trends in player attributes using statistical charts and heatmaps.
   - Compare distributions of key attributes across FIFA versions.
   - Perform correlation analysis between player attributes and performance metrics.

3. **Player Evolution Analysis**
   - Track attribute changes for top players like Messi and Ronaldo across different FIFA versions.
   - Compare their FIFA statistics with real-life performance metrics.

4. **Budget Optimization Study**
   - Use statistical models to determine the budget required to build an elite team.
   - Perform regression analysis to assess the relationship between budget and team performance.

5. **Trend Analysis in Player Attributes**
   - Identify patterns in the skill sets of the top 5% of players.
   - Determine if FIFA versions have favored certain playing styles (technical vs. physical attributes).

### **Expected Outcomes**
- A clear visualization of attribute evolution in iconic players.
- A data-driven guide for assembling a high-performance team within budget constraints.
- Insights into attribute trends that influence FIFA gameplay mechanics.
- An understanding of how FIFA statistics align with real-world player performance.

### **Conclusion**
This project will provide a comprehensive analysis of the FIFA 2022 dataset, uncovering valuable insights into player progression, budget efficiency in team formation, and trends in key attributes over time. The findings will be useful for gamers, analysts, and researchers interested in understanding the evolution of virtual player attributes and their alignment with real-world football trends.
